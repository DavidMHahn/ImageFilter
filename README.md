# ImageFilter
This is the readme file for the Image Filter project I created during the Coursera MOOC class- Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS -by Duke University.<br>
This program allows one to use Codepen.io to run the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.<br>
You can then upload an image using the Choose Files button in the console.<br>
There are four (4) filter type buttons and one clear filter button.<br>
You can add a filter to your image, then clear the filter, then add another filter.<br>
The filter types are: Gray scale, Red Filter, Rainbow Filter, and Blur Effect.<br>
You can add layers of filter to the image, by clicking multiple filter buttons with out clearing the previous filter.<br>
This can get messy after a while though.<br>
